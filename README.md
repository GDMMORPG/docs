# GDMMORPG Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Godot MMORPG Project, built with Next.js and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Documentation Sections

- **Technical Design** - Technical specifications, architecture, and implementation details
- **Game Design** - Game mechanics, systems design, and gameplay features
- **Art Bible** - Visual style guide, asset specifications, and artistic direction
- **Audio Bible** - Sound design principles, music direction, and audio specifications

## Local Development

To run the documentation site locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the static-site-source directory
cd static-site-source

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Building for Production

```bash
# Navigate to the static-site-source directory
cd static-site-source

# Build the site
npm run build

# The static files will be in the 'out' directory
```

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

The documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch via GitHub Actions.

The deployment workflow:
1. Builds the Next.js static site
2. Exports to static HTML/CSS/JS
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

### Branch Preview Deployments

Branch previews are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages for pull requests with branch-specific base paths using the `docs-preview` path prefix.

**How it works:**
- When you open a PR, a preview deployment is automatically triggered
- The preview is built with a branch-specific base path (e.g., `/docs-preview/your-branch-name/`)
- All internal links and assets are configured for this branch-specific path
- The preview is deployed to the `github-pages-preview-{PR#}` environment
- A comment is added to the PR with the preview URL
- The preview is automatically updated when new commits are pushed to the PR

**Viewing a preview:**
1. Open your PR on GitHub
2. Look for the comment with "ðŸš€ Preview Deployment Complete"
3. Click the preview URL to view your changes live at the branch-specific path
4. Check the "Environments" section in GitHub to see deployment history

**Branch-specific paths:**
Each preview is built with its own base path like `/docs-preview/branch-name/`. This means:
- The site expects to be served from that specific path
- All internal navigation and assets use that path prefix
- The environment URL reflects the branch-specific path
- Previews use the `docs-preview` prefix to distinguish them from the main docs at `/docs`

> **Important:** GitHub Pages standard deployment serves files at the root. While previews are built with branch-specific paths using `/docs-preview/`, only the most recent preview deployment will be accessible since GitHub Pages can serve only one deployment at a time. The main production site at `/docs` is restored when changes are merged to `main`.

## Adding Documentation

### Creating New Documentation Pages

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory in `static-site-source/pages/`:
   - `Technical Design/` for technical documentation
   - `Game Design/` for game design documentation
   - `Art Bible/` for art bible documentation
   - `Audio Bible/` for audio bible documentation

2. Create a new Markdown file with front matter:

```markdown
---
title: Your Page Title
description: Brief description of the page
---

# Your Content Here

Write your documentation in Markdown format.
```

3. The page will automatically be rendered and added to the site

### Adding Blog Posts

1. Create a new Markdown file in `static-site-source/blog/`
2. Add front matter with title, description, date, and coverImage:

```markdown
---
title: Your Blog Post Title
description: Brief description of the post
date: 2025-10-30
coverImage: /images/blog/your-image.jpg
---

# Your blog post content here
```

3. The latest blog post will automatically appear on the home page

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework with static site generation
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **next-mdx-remote** - MDX rendering for Markdown content
- **gray-matter** - Front matter parsing
