# Welcome to the Godot MMORPG Project!

Welcome to our ambitious journey of creating a World of Warcraft-inspired MMORPG built entirely in Godot! We're excited to have you here as we embark on this collaborative adventure.

## What We're Building

The Godot MMORPG project is a comprehensive framework designed to provide developers with a complete suite of tools and infrastructure necessary to launch MMORPGs of any scale. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, our project aims to give you the foundation you need to create engaging multiplayer experiences.

## Our Inspiration

Drawing inspiration from the legendary World of Warcraft, we're crafting a system that captures the essence of what makes MMORPGs compelling while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Godot engine. Our goal is to democratize MMORPG development by providing robust, scalable solutions that would typically require years of development to create from scratch.

## Project Objectives

Our primary objective is to create a extensible framework that serves as a solid foundation for MMORPG development. This isn't just a game—it's a platform that developers can build upon, customize, and expand to create their own unique worlds and experiences.

## Contributing and Attribution

We believe in recognizing the valuable contributions of our community. Every developer who maintains a pull request will be proudly listed in our contributors section, helping you build your portfolio through meaningful open-source work.

## Licensing Philosophy

We operate under a unique combination of Open Attribution License (OAL), BSD 3-Clause, and CC BY 4.0 License. This ensures that every contributor—from engineers to artists—receives guaranteed attribution for their work on the project. Your contributions matter, and we make sure they're properly recognized.

Join us as we build something extraordinary together. The future of indie MMORPG development starts here!
