# Network

This section covers network architecture, protocols, and implementation details for the MMORPG.

## Network Architecture

The network layer handles all client-server communication, ensuring reliable and efficient data transfer.

### Key Components

- **Connection Manager**: Handles client connections and disconnections
- **Packet Router**: Routes network packets to appropriate handlers
- **Protocol Layer**: Implements the game protocol specification
- **Synchronization**: Ensures game state consistency across clients

## Communication Protocols

Details about the communication protocols used in the game.

### Protocol Design

The protocol is designed for:
- Low latency
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Security

## Network Optimization

Strategies for optimizing network performance and reducing bandwidth usage.
